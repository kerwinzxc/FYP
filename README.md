# Final Year Project
## 3D Virtual Simulation based on PhysX

### Introduction
PhysX is a realtime physics engine middleware SDK, which can accelerate the physics computations by either a PhysX PPU or a CUDA-enabled GeForce GPU. It has widely used in computer games and applications to offloading physics calculations from the CPU for acceleration. In this project, an interactive physical simulation framework will be constructed based on PhysX. 3D models can be imported into the framework and the users can manipulate virtual objects interactively.

### Project requirement(s) and objective(s)
